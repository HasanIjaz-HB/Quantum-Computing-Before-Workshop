Local Installation

To use this repository locally, you need a python 3 environment and a few other dependencies.

- jupyter
- numpy
- matplotlib
- qiskit
- qiskit-terra[visualization]

Since we use Anaconda distribution to manage python envirionments and packages, we will make such an installation. 

1-First install python 3 version of either [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). 

2-Open the conda command line. Inside the folder before_workshop, use the following command to setup the environment. Depending on your internet connection this may take some time.

```
conda env create -f setup/environment.yml
```

3-Now that everything is installed, you can activate the conda environment and start jupyter server using the following commands inside the folder before_workshop. A new browser windows should launch automatically. 

```
conda activate bronze-workshop
jupyter lab index_bronze.ipynb
```

If you have problems, then try another alternative:

2-Open the conda command line. Use the following command to install qiskit.

```
pip install qiskit==0.13.0
``
`
3-Now that everything is installed, you can activate the conda environment and start jupyter server using the following commands inside the folder before_workshop. A new browser windows should launch automatically. 

```
jupyter lab index_bronze.ipynb
```
